<h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">My IT Profile</h1>

	<p style="color:maroon;text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Lewis Smith, s3406580, Lewis94@live.com.au</p>
<hr>

<h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Introduction</h1>

	<p style="color:maroon;text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Hi, my name is Lewis Smith, 25 and from England originally, English being my only spoken language. My highest education is a preparation program with USQ, i eventually decided USQ wasn't the place for me.
	My hobby is building and repairing computers and also video games.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">My interest in IT and why i chose to study at RMIT</h1>

	<p style="color:maroon;text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Well, from a very young age, i'd say around 10 years old i was introduced video games from my grandad. Naturally as a kid i thoroughly enjoyed it!
	I would eventually get hooked on video games and that is all i did until i hit the age of around 14. This was when i learnt about video games on a computer.
	I played Runescape ever since then but it also spiked interest in the computer itself. I learnt myself how applications operated, the process behind how an application would open and close for example.
	Eventually i earned enough money when i was old enough to work to purchase and build my own desktop computer.
	I watched tonnes of guides before my purchase and learnt to build pcs and all the hardware it involves. Alot of my friends at school played computer games aswell,
	i would try to fix problems on their machines if they occured because simply put, i enjoyed it.</p>
	
	<p style="color:maroon;text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">I chose to study at RMIT mainly because to me it seemed like a well suited institute for what i am trying to learn. Another reason is because it is online! It fits perfectly into my lifestyle as i work night shifts.
	My expectations from studying this course to become work ready for the IT industry, aquiring all the knowledge i need to start this new and exciting career path. I am also trying to improve my ability to work in a group
	as i am a very quiet person and tend to keep to myself.</p>

	<p style="color:maroon;text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Going over these results made it easier for me to understand how i think and learn and unfortunatley, how uncreative i am!

<h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Project idea</h1>

	<h2 style="text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Overview</h2>
		
		<p style="color:maroon;text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">The Idea I have is a productivity bot for Discord. With technology ever increasing,
		Discord has taken one of the top spots for online voice communication applications. Not only can you connect with voice, 
		but you can also have text-based channels to enhance the experience with connecting people from around the world. With these text-based channels you can create bots that can perform actions you design it to perform. 
		For example, many bots exist that can play a song from YouTube and the bot will join a voice channel and begin playing the selected song in the voice chat for others to listen. 
		My idea is to create a bot that will help students and basically anyone to improve on their productivity online.</p>
		
	<h2 style="text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Motivation</h2>
		
		<p style="color:maroon;text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">With 250 million users on Discord, there would be so many people that can benefit from this idea. 
		Personally, I struggle keeping motivated or managing my time during a study period, 
		to me a bot like this would be a huge game changer for me as I have something to remind me of important assignments coming up for example. 
		I’m also a user of Discord, I use this application to connect with my friends overseas or play games with my local friends with voice communication. 
		I’ve been very interested in coding and creating applications/bots, so this seems like a perfect idea for me.</p>
		
	<h2 style="text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Description</h2>
	
		<p style="color:maroon;text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">I hope to implement enough features into this bot to maximize efficiency and increased productivity rates. 
		One feature I plan to implement is a timer that will for example, countdown from 1 hour and tell you to take breaks in between. 
		This is a very simple but effective feature, you can get carried away and forget to eat or drink or just lose track of time so this feature will keep things like this in check. 
		Another feature I’m planning on adding is a reminder function, this feature will be able to take commands to set a reminder for a certain time on a certain day, or even recurring. 
		For example, I could have an assignment due on 23rd March 18:00. 
		The bot would take this information and when that time arrives it would display a message to the creator of the reminder a week, a day, an hour before the assignment is due. 
		Again, very simple but effective. It would be able to track many different users reminders and timers and if there is many users on the same server I could make it instead of using public text channels, 
		it would use direct messages to the bot for clutter management. Another feature I plan to add is the ability for the bot to fetch wiki links related to the command you give it. 
		For example, I want to search on wiki about IT, I would send it a command such as: !bot wiki Information technology. This would reply with a link to a wiki page related to IT. 
		You might be asking, it’s just as fast if you look this up yourself? This may be true but the entire idea around this project is, if you’re already a big user of Discord and you use it often, 
		this bot would enhance your experience even further from being an all-in-one application to talk and connect to a study environment that assists you with said study. 
		What if you don’t have a calculator at hand? You can simply request the bot to do a calculation. Give it an equation for example, “!bot calc 5 / 2 * 4 + 3” and It will respond with 13. 
		I’m not planning creating a fancy bot that will make users jaw drop but keeping it simple, tidy and efficient. The idea is just to improve your studying experience.</p>
		
	<h2 style="text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Tools and technologies</h2>
	
		<img src="Node.png">
		
		<p style="color:maroon;text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">To begin with creating a Discord bot, I will need to use Node.JS. Node.JS is a runtime environment, 
		essentially you write your code with node and you can run the code you have written in node into a working application.</p>
		
		<img src="JS.png">

		<p style="color:maroon;text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">I will be using the JavaScript programming language to create the bot, within node as it’s the most familiar to me. 
		I would say JavaScript is the easiest language to learn and code with but that is my personal preference.</p>
		
		<img src="github.png">

		<p style ="color:maroon;text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">I will also be using GitHub to store and manage my code. Other than Node, GitHub and a machine to work on there isn’t much more to use, 
		these are the ideal tools and technologies that I will be using.</p>
		
	<h2 style="text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Skills required</h2>
	
		<p style="color:maroon;text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">I think just a basic understanding of how a discord bot functions and the how you want it to work. 
		Knowing how to code with JavaScript is also very important as this is how you will tell the bot what to do. I am not a very good programmer so I will be learning how to use all 3 of the tools I have listed above. 
		I have very little knowledge of GitHub which will be important for me to learn in the future. As well as JavaScript, It is the language I was introduced to but I am in no way very good at it!</p>
		
	<h2 style="text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">Outcome</h2>
	
		<p style="color:maroon;text-align:center;font-family:Bookman Old Style;">If this project would be to be completed, 
		I think It would have a very big impact on how Discord users use the application to further enhance their own study skills. 
		With very little knowledge you can simply install this bot into your server and learn how to use the commands, with little effort you’ll be increasing study productivity in no time. 
		I hope this project would also relieve some stress students go through when they are overwhelmed with assignment after assignment. 
		I would be using this myself as I can see this being very beneficial to my study practices.</p>
